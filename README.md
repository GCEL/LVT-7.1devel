# LVT-devel
Development sandbox for LVT (at v7.1)

This a sandbox repo for making changes to LVT (**Land-surface Verification Toolkit**) within GCEL use. If these changes are useful to others and tested well, we should consider contributing them back to the original code owners and their svn repository.
